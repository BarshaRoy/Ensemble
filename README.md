# Ensemble
Hello. I have tried to build an ensemble model using ViT and CNN. I have tried different CNN architectures here with a custom ViT model. Here I have applied ResNet101v2 with ViT and in another type, I have applied the ensemble to the custom CNN and ViT model. I have done a weighted ensemble here, assigning different weights to the models.
I have used this multiclass leukemia  dataset. The dataset is available on https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mehradaria/leukemia
